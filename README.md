Dotfiles and configuration for development workspace and workflow

# Dependencies
The installation of these configuration files relies on [stow](https://github.com/aspiers/stow/).

You can install most of the prereqs via the command `./install-prereqs`

For installation instructions on a mac,
please see the [documentation here](https://macappstore.org/stow/).

# Contents
This repo contains configuration for my workflows in:
* nvim
* tmux
* zsh

# Credits
This workflow and .dotfile design was almost entirely inspired by, [The Primeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/).
You can find his [.dotfiles here](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles). Huge thanks to him and his awesome tutorials
on Vim and workflows surrounding the use of Vim! His tutorials are [on YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/theprimeagen) if you would like to learn also.
